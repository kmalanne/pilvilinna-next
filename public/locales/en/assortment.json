The cake menu, which changes three times a year, offers cakes with current and seasonal flavors. You can also always choose your favorite Dream come true option, in which case you will get a cake that suits your taste. I use vanilla meringue buttercream as the icing on the cakes. For cakes, for an additional price, a sugar paste figure 5€/ figure and gold leaf 2-10€ depending on the quantity. Very generous decorations, e.g. with real flowers, also increase the price of the cake.",
